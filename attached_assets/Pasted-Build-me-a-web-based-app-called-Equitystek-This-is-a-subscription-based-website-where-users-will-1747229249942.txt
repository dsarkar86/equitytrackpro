Build me a web based app  called "Equitystek". This is a subscription-based website where users will register first through the portal and identify themselves as (1) home/property owners (2) Trades persons (e.g. electricians, carpenters etc) or investors. The app will allow users to upload the history and  description of any maintenance tasks or renovations  that  they have undertaken at that individual property. Home or property owners may have many properties so during the registration process, they would be able to provide/list these properties with correct addresses. If the owner or real estate agent who is responsible for properties hires a trades person to undertake works, the trades person should also be able to upload and description and the total costs of the work they have undertaken with their credential including business name, Australian business number, contact details etc. They will have to sign off on the works in the system by confirming above deatils.  (3) Investors can also register and request records of maintenance history of the property for a fee if they have an interest to purchase. Details of the request with appear on the owners/members home page history for the individual property etc.
The aim of this platform is to use the maintenance history (how well the property/home has been maintained over the years) and use this to actually calculate the value of the property or home.  For example, a vehicle has a maintenance history and this determines the sale value. I would like to apply the same principle here but for home/properties. So when it comes to selling the home or property, the seller and the buyer know and have the maintenance records to decide and or agree on the sales value of the property. The seller will be in a better position armed with this maintenance records that are verified by trades persons who undertook the works.
Property/home sales prices are calculated use below methods:
•	Comparable sales Methods
•	Per square meter (PPSM)
•	Automated valuations model
•	Cost Approach 
•	Income Approach (cap rate)
I would like the app to also use these matrixes as well but include the value of the renovations, upgrades or other maintenance works to come up with the final and more realistic and updated sales value.
Build and full back end and front end platform for this app. I have a strip account and would like to use this as the means for subscription and for any payments. I also have a domain already
